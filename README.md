## Dataset

**Fruits-360** (Version 2026.5.12.0) - 102,551 images across 145 classes (fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds).

This project uses a **12-class subset** + background:
- Apple, Banana, Cabbage, Carrot, Cucumber, Grape, Onion, Orange, Papaya, Pepper, Strawberry, Tomato
- Background (from COCO unlabeled2017)

(Eggplant was removed — 0 images in the dataset. 13 outputs total.)

Split: 50% Training / 25% Validation / 25% Test (preserves original Fruits-360 specimen-level splits)

## Models Trained

| Model | Preprocessing | Parameters |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| **MobileNetV2** | `mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input` (→ [-1, 1]) | ~3.5M |
| **EfficientNetB0** | `efficientnet.preprocess_input` (→ [0, 255] internal) | ~5.3M |

## Key Pipeline Fixes Applied

1. **Per-model preprocessing** (critical): Both models now receive raw [0, 255] images from generators. Each model has a `Lambda` preprocessing layer:
   - MobileNetV2: scales to [-1, 1] via `mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input`
   - EfficientNetB0: passes through unchanged; model's internal layers handle scaling

2. **Removed `rescale=1./255`** from all `ImageDataGenerator` instances — was causing double-scaling for EfficientNetB0

3. **BatchNorm freezing during fine-tuning**: BN running statistics frozen (`layer.trainable = False`) on the frozen stem to prevent corruption; BN inside the unfrozen window is trained (batch size 64 keeps stats stable)

4. **Original dataset splits preserved**: Uses Fruits-360's original Training/Validation/Test folders (specimen-level split by k, k+1, k+2, k+3 rule), not random image-level shuffle

5. **Folder→class mapping fixed**: Merges Fruit-360 variety folders into their parent classes via prefix matching (e.g. `Apple Braeburn` → `Apple`) instead of exact-name matching, which was silently dropping all suffixed varieties (Apple, Grape, Onion, Pepper had zero images)

6. **Background replacement as a gated layer**: `RandomBackgroundReplace` is a `Layer` subclass with a `training` argument — augmentation runs only during `fit()`, passes through at inference, and keeps `tf.random.uniform` out of the exported TFLite graph (was previously breaking `converter.convert()`)

7. **Verified downloads & extraction**: COCO download uses a verified SSL context (certifi + system-cert fallback, no bypass); both zip extractions go through `safe_extract_member`, which blocks path traversal outside the destination

8. **Empty-class safety**: class weights are computed only over classes present in training data (`np.unique`); the generators cell prints a per-class count table flagging any empty class; `classification_report`/`confusion_matrix` calls pass explicit `labels=` so empty classes render as zero rows instead of crashing

9. **Determinism & coverage**: `random.seed(42)` before the COCO shuffle; `steps_per_epoch`/`validation_steps` use `math.ceil` so partial batches are included; `BG_THRESHOLD` and `FINE_TUNE_LAYERS` are named config constants

## Scalability Optimizations

- **Mixed precision (`mixed_float16`)**: ~2x faster training on T4 with lower VRAM usage
- **Batch size 64**: more stable BatchNorm stats, better GPU utilization
- **Callbacks on `val_accuracy`** (not `val_loss`): early stopping + best-weights checkpointing align with the actual goal; `TerminateOnNaN` guards against divergence
- **GPU memory growth + device detection** at startup
- **Ensemble evaluation**: results.json includes averaged-probability ensemble accuracy (typically +1-3% over best single model)
- **Export verification**: save cell writes `labels.json` (`{index: name}`), exports FP16 TFLite variants (`*_model_fp16.tflite`), and runs a keras-vs-tflite parity check stored as `tflite_parity` in results.json (warns if mean diff > 0.05)

## Training Details

Target accuracy: **90-95% on the test set** (single models); the ensemble in results.json typically lands at the top of that range.

### MobileNetV2
- Phase 1 (Head): 20 epochs, LR 1e-3 → 1e-5 (cosine decay + warmup)
- Phase 2 (Fine-tune last 30 layers): 20 epochs, LR 5e-5 → 1e-6

### EfficientNetB0
- Phase 1 (Head): 20 epochs, LR 1e-3 → 1e-5
- Phase 2 (Fine-tune last 30 layers): 25 epochs, LR 5e-5 → 1e-7

Shared: AdamW (weight_decay=1e-4), Label Smoothing (0.1), Class Weights (balanced), Top-3 Accuracy metric, mixed float16

## Requirements

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm
```

## Usage

### Training (Google Colab)

1. Open `model.ipynb` in Google Colab (GPU runtime)
2. Upload `CropIQ.zip` to Drive: `MyDrive/CropIQ/CropIQ.zip`
3. Run cells top-to-bottom (17 code cells with markdown headers) — handles extraction, class merging, background download, training both models, evaluation, ensemble, and export
4. Models saved to Drive: `best_mobilenet.keras`, `best_efficientnet.keras` (+ `_finetuned` variants)
5. TFLite exports: `mobilenet_model.tflite` (+ `_fp16` variant), `efficientnet_model.tflite` (+ `_fp16` variant), `labels.txt`, `labels.json`
6. **Results file**: `results.json` — contains test accuracy, per-class precision/recall/F1, confusion matrices, training history, inference benchmarks, ensemble accuracy, and `tflite_parity` metrics for both models.

### Model Artifacts

Trained artifacts are stored in `models/` (Git LFS tracked):

```bash
# After training, copy from Drive to repo:
cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/CropIQ/*.keras" models/
cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/CropIQ/*.tflite" models/
cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/CropIQ/labels.txt" models/
cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/CropIQ/labels.json" models/
cp "/content/drive/MyDrive/CropIQ/results.json" models/
```

Then commit (Git LFS handles large files):

```bash
git add models/
git commit -m "Add trained models + artifacts"
git push
```

### Android Integration

For the CropIQ Android app, copy only the TFLite model + labels to `app/src/main/assets/`:

```
app/src/main/assets/
├── mobilenet_model.tflite      (or efficientnet_model.tflite, or _fp16 variants)
├── labels.txt                  (or labels.json — {index: name} mapping)
```

Use the provided `CropIQClassifier` Kotlin class (supports GPU/NNAPI delegates, Flex ops).

### Branch

Active development on `cropiq-android-integration` branch:

```bash
git checkout cropiq-android-integration
```

## Known Limitations

- **Background domain shift**: Training uses random background augmentation; validation/test use original white studio backgrounds. Real-world deployment (phone camera) will have varied backgrounds.
- **External test set needed**: 100% accuracy on studio photos ≠ real-world performance. Collect 50–100 phone photos under natural conditions as a holdout set before trusting deployment metrics.
- **TFLite models require Flex delegate** (`SELECT_TF_OPS`) due to mixed-precision training. For pure TFLite, retrain with `float32` policy. INT8 quantization deferred — needs uint8 app-contract change + re-measured accuracy; use FP16 variants first.
- **App-side gating required**: never display predictions below ~50% confidence; treat `Background` top-1 as "no fruit detected," not as an answer.
